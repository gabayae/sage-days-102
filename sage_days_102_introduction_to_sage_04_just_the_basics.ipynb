    "Sage is especially useful in dealing with expressions containing variables like $x^{2} - y^{2}\\,z^{2} + z^{3}$ or $\\sin^{3}(x) - 2\\,\\cos^{2}(x) + \\sin(x) - 1$. These are the kind of expressions that mathematicians and physicists are used to. The variables $x$, $y$, and $z$ that appear in those expressions are symbolic variables. In general, they differ from the Python variables discussed in the previous section. In Sage, the symbolic variables should be explicitly declared before being used except for the symbolic variable $x$ which is already defined. To declare a symbolic variable, we do the following: "

However, when one uses the old SageNB notebook interface which I discuss briefly in <a href=\"#the-old-sagenb-notebook\">Section 12.4</a> of this notebook, with the command, `automatic_names(True)` one can make Sage behave like the computer algebra systems I mentioned earlier. That is, one can decide not to declare symbolic variables before using them and Sage will not complain. However, this do not work when one uses the Jupyter notebook. But it does mean that it can not be done. In fact, if you are able to this, you will be improving on Sage and maybe you will become famous. Therefore, I propose this exercise which is a project in itself."
