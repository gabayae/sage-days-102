    "[CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) ([<https://cocalc.com/>](https://cocalc.com/)) formerly called SageMath Cloud is an abbreviation for **Co**llaborative **Cal**culation in the **C**loud. It is a sophicated web application for online computations which requires no installation. Apart from SageMath, it runs other softwares like IPython, LaTeX, C++, Julia, Python, Ruby, Haskell, etc. It's particularly good for collaboration on an entire project across large distances. In order to have access to [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/), you will have to [sign-up here](https://cocalc.com/settings?session=default) by creating an account. Here is a youtube video which provides more detials on [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/)."

    "The SageMath cell server ([<http://sagecell.sagemath.org/>](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/)) is somewhat analogous to Wolfram Alpha and other computational websites. You just type in a command and it does it for you. It doesn't have a \"memory\" so it is not useful for long computations, but very convenient if you are on the internet and just want to try something quickly. This is convenient for many reasons; for some sage developers, it is useful for making class notes that are themselves websites. Here is an [example](http://www.math-cs.gordon.edu/~kcrisman/mat338/MAT338Day2-2013.html)."
